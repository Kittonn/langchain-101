       "'<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the capital of Thailand is. Hmm, where do I start? I know that Thailand is one of those countries in Southeast Asia, right? It\\'s pretty famous for stuff like beaches and tourist spots. But when it comes to capitals, I\\'m a bit fuzzy on the details.\\n\\nI remember that many Asian countries have capitals somewhere else than their main city. For example, Japan has Tokyo as its capital instead of Kyoto or Hakone. So maybe Thailand isn\\'t different? Wait, isn\\'t Bangkok a big city in Thailand? I think it\\'s also known as the \"Goldenzent\" because of all the yellow things there.\\n\\nWait, so is Bangkok the capital? That sounds right. But how can I be sure? Maybe I should think about other countries nearby. Like, what\\'s the capital of Indonesia? It\\'s Jakarta, which isn\\'t its main city but a big port city instead. So maybe Thailand follows a similar pattern?\\n\\nI\\'ve heard people talk about going to Bangkok for travel or business, so it must be the administrative center. That would make sense because the government would need to be in an accessible and important location. Plus, I think they have a nice airport there too.\\n\\nOh, but wait, what if I\\'m mixing it up with another country? Like, is there another city that\\'s more prominent? I don\\'t recall hearing about any other major cities as capitals besides Bangkok. So yeah, I think it must be Bangkok.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of Thailand is Bangkok.'"
